# Authorization Security

## Authorization Principles

- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Separation of duties**: Divide sensitive operations across multiple users
- **Need-to-know basis**: Restrict access to information based on job requirements
- **Regular access reviews**: Periodically review and update user permissions
- **Zero trust model**: Verify every request as if it originates from an untrusted network

## Access Control Models

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Implement clearly defined roles and permissions
- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)**: Use attributes for dynamic authorization decisions
- **Mandatory access control (MAC)**: Enforce system-level access policies
- **Discretionary access control (DAC)**: Allow resource owners to control access
- **Rule-based access control**: Use conditional rules for access decisions

## Resource Protection

- **Resource-level permissions**: Check authorization for each protected resource
- **Operation-level security**: Authorize specific actions (read, write, delete, execute)
- **Dynamic authorization**: Re-evaluate permissions for sensitive operations
- **Context-aware authorization**: Consider time, location, device in access decisions
- **Hierarchical permissions**: Implement parent-child resource relationships

## Authorization Implementation

- **Centralized authorization**: Use consistent authorization mechanisms across systems
- **Policy decision points**: Implement clear authorization decision logic
- **Policy enforcement points**: Ensure authorization is checked at all access points
- **Permission inheritance**: Handle permission inheritance properly
- **Default deny**: Implement secure defaults that deny access by default

## CSRF & State Management

- **CSRF protection**: Implement anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **State validation**: Verify state parameters in authorization flows
- **Secure redirects**: Validate redirect URLs to prevent open redirects
- **Referrer validation**: Check referrer headers for sensitive operations
- **Same-origin verification**: Enforce same-origin policies where appropriate

## Authorization Monitoring

- **Access pattern monitoring**: Track unusual access patterns or privilege escalation
- **Permission changes**: Log all permission modifications
- **Failed authorization attempts**: Monitor and alert on authorization failures
- **Privilege usage tracking**: Monitor use of high-privilege operations
- **Access audit trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all access decisions
