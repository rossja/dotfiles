# Dependency & Code Security

## Dependency Management

- **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities
- **Version pinning**: Pin dependency versions to avoid supply chain attacks
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
- **Trusted sources**: Download dependencies from official, trusted repositories
- **License compliance**: Ensure dependency licenses are compatible

## Secure Coding Practices

- **Code review**: Implement mandatory peer code reviews for security
- **Static analysis**: Use SAST tools to identify potential vulnerabilities
- **Avoid dangerous functions**: Avoid eval(), exec(), deserialization of untrusted data
- **Memory safety**: Use memory-safe languages or safe practices in unsafe languages
- **Integer overflow protection**: Check for arithmetic overflow conditions

## Software Composition Analysis

- **SBOM generation**: Maintain software bill of materials
- **Vulnerability databases**: Regular checks against CVE databases
- **Update policies**: Establish policies for updating vulnerable dependencies
- **Alternative assessment**: Evaluate alternative dependencies when vulnerabilities exist
- **Dependency tree analysis**: Understand transitive dependencies and their risks

## Build & Deployment Security

- **Secure build pipeline**: Protect build processes from tampering
- **Code signing**: Sign releases to ensure integrity
- **Container security**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure as code**: Secure configuration management
- **Deployment verification**: Verify deployed code matches intended release

## Development Environment Security

- **Developer workstation security**: Secure development environments
- **IDE security**: Keep development tools updated and properly configured
- **Source code protection**: Secure access to source code repositories
- **Secrets in development**: Avoid committing secrets to version control
- **Development data**: Use anonymized data in development environments
