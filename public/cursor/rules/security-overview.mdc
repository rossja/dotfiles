# Security Overview & Guidelines

## Purpose of This File

This file provides high-level security principles and helps determine which specific security rule files are most relevant for different types of development work.

## When to Apply Specific Security Files

### For API Development (security-api.mdc)
- Building REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, or microservices
- Implementing API gateways or service meshes
- Working on machine-to-machine communication
- Developing webhook handlers or API integrations

### For Web Applications (security-web.mdc)
- Building traditional web applications with user interfaces
- Working with forms, user sessions, and browser interactions
- Implementing Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Developing Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

### For Authentication Systems (security-authentication.mdc)
- Implementing login/logout functionality
- Working with passwords, MFA, or biometric authentication
- Building OAuth/OpenID Connect providers or consumers
- Managing user sessions and tokens

### For Authorization Systems (security-authorization.mdc)
- Implementing role-based or attribute-based access control
- Building permission systems or policy engines
- Working with resource-level access controls
- Developing privilege escalation protections

### For Data Handling (security-data-protection.mdc)
- Working with sensitive data, PII, or payment information
- Implementing encryption at rest or in transit
- Building key management systems
- Handling data privacy and GDPR compliance

### For Input Processing (security-input-validation.mdc)
- Processing user input, form data, or file uploads
- Building search functionality or content filters
- Working with parsers (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Implementing data transformation pipelines

### For Error Handling (security-error-handling.mdc)
- Implementing exception handling and error recovery
- Building custom error pages or responses
- Working on debugging and troubleshooting features
- Developing graceful degradation mechanisms

### For Logging Systems (security-logging.mdc)
- Implementing application logging or audit trails
- Building log aggregation or analysis systems
- Working on security monitoring dashboards
- Developing incident response tools

### For Information Security (security-info-disclosure.mdc)
- Implementing system information protection
- Working on production deployments and configurations
- Building admin interfaces or debug endpoints
- Developing system monitoring or health checks

### For Security Monitoring (security-monitoring.mdc)
- Building security dashboards or alerting systems
- Implementing intrusion detection or anomaly detection
- Working on security incident response tools
- Developing threat intelligence integration

### For Code & Dependencies (security-dependencies.mdc)
- Managing third-party libraries and dependencies
- Implementing build pipelines or CI/CD systems
- Working on code analysis or security scanning
- Developing containerized applications

## Universal Security Principles

Regardless of the specific domain, always consider these fundamental principles:

### Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls
- Don't rely on a single security measure
- Assume each layer can be bypassed and plan accordingly

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Regularly review and reduce access levels
- Implement just-in-time access where possible

### Security by Design
- Consider security implications from the beginning
- Build security into the architecture, not bolt it on later
- Perform threat modeling during design phase

### Fail Securely
- Ensure failures result in a secure state
- Default to denying access when systems fail
- Implement graceful degradation with security maintained

### Keep It Simple
- Complex security systems are harder to secure
- Prefer standard, well-tested solutions over custom implementations
- Avoid security through obscurity

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Some security aspects span multiple files and should always be considered:

### Encryption Everywhere
- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS, TLS)
- Encrypt data at rest (database, file storage)
- Use strong, modern encryption algorithms

### Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies and frameworks updated
- Apply security patches promptly
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in used components

### Security Testing
- Include security testing in your development process
- Perform regular penetration testing and code reviews
- Use automated security scanning tools

### Incident Response Planning
- Have a plan for when security incidents occur
- Practice incident response procedures
- Maintain incident response documentation and contacts

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Mobile Applications
- Apply both security-api.mdc (for backend APIs) and security-web.mdc (for WebView components)
- Add mobile-specific considerations like app signing, root detection, certificate pinning

### Cloud-Native Applications
- Focus on security-api.mdc, security-dependencies.mdc, and security-monitoring.mdc
- Consider container security, service mesh policies, and cloud provider security features

### Legacy System Integration
- Emphasize security-data-protection.mdc and security-input-validation.mdc
- Consider additional validation and sanitization layers
- Implement security proxies or gateways where direct modifications aren't possible

### High-Security Environments
- Apply ALL security files rigorously
- Implement additional controls like network segmentation, hardware security modules
- Consider compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI DSS, FedRAMP, etc.)
