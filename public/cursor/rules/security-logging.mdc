# Logging Security

## Logging Best Practices

- **Security event logging**: Log authentication, authorization, and access events
- **No sensitive data**: Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or other sensitive data
- **Structured logging**: Use consistent, machine-readable log formats
- **Log sanitization**: Remove or mask sensitive information from logs
- **Contextual logging**: Include relevant context without exposing sensitive details

## Log Content Security

- **Data classification in logs**: Classify log data based on sensitivity
- **Log data minimization**: Only log necessary information for security and debugging
- **Personal data protection**: Comply with privacy regulations in logging
- **Tokenization in logs**: Use tokens instead of actual sensitive values
- **Log correlation**: Include correlation IDs for tracking without exposing user data

## Log Storage & Management

- **Log rotation**: Implement log rotation and retention policies
- **Log integrity**: Protect logs from tampering with checksums/signatures
- **Centralized logging**: Aggregate logs from all system components
- **Log encryption**: Encrypt logs containing sensitive information
- **Access controls**: Restrict access to logs based on need-to-know

## Log Analysis & Retention

- **Log analysis tools**: Implement tools for log searching and analysis
- **Retention policies**: Define how long different types of logs are kept
- **Log archival**: Secure long-term storage of important logs
- **Log disposal**: Secure deletion of logs after retention period
- **Backup and recovery**: Ensure logs are backed up and recoverable
